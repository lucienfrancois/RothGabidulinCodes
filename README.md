The algorithm ```ColumnWiseDecoder(n,mu1,mu2)```, i.e. the fibre-wise decoder only in one direction.\
The algorithm ```FibreWiseDecoder(n,mu1,mu2)```, i.e. the fibre-wise decoder with correction in the second direction.\
The algorithm used for Gabidulin decoding is in [this paper by Antonia Wachter-Zeh, Valentin Afanassiev & Vladimir Sidorenko](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10623-012-9659-5.pdf?pdf=inline%20link).\
